# Adventure 2


Make another short "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. However, this
time you need to use a loop so that they can freely move from room to
room and back again.


There need to be at least six rooms or destinations, and at least two
different ways for the game to end.

MITCHELL'S TINY ADVENTURE 2!

You are in a creepy house!  Would you like to go "upstairs" or into the
"kitchen"?
> kitchen

There is a long countertop with dirty dishes everywhere.  Off to one side
there is, as you'd expect, a refrigerator.  You may open the "refrigerator"
or go "back".
> back

You are in a creepy house!  Would you like to go "upstairs" or into the
"kitchen"?
> upstairs

Upstairs you see a hallway.  At the end of the hallway is the master
"bedroom".  There is also a "bathroom" off the hallway.  Or, you can
go back "downstairs". Where would you like to go?
> downstairs

You are in a creepy house!  Would you like to go "upstairs" or into the
"kitchen"?
> kitchen

There is a long countertop with dirty dishes everywhere.  Off to one side
there is, as you'd expect, a refrigerator.  You may open the "refrigerator"
or go "back".
> refrigerator

Inside the refrigerator you see food and stuff.  It looks pretty nasty.
Would you like to eat some of the food? ("yes" or "no")
> yes

The food is slimy and foul, but you manage to choke it down. Your stomach
starts jumping like a frog in hot water.  You feel faint. Sliding to the
floor, the darkness closes in.

You have died.
