# Basic Lists 0


Create an empty list. Append to the array the number `-113` *ten times* using the `list.append()` method. Then display the contents of the list on the screen. One element at a time.

*Do not* use a loop. Also, do not use any variable for the index;
you must use literal numbers to refer to each slot.

Name the file `list0.py`

```
Slot 0 contains a -113
Slot 1 contains a -113
Slot 2 contains a -113
Slot 3 contains a -113
Slot 4 contains a -113
Slot 5 contains a -113
Slot 6 contains a -113
Slot 7 contains a -113
Slot 8 contains a -113
Slot 9 contains a -113

```
