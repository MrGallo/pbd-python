# Favourite Colour

Take the code from the [previous exercise](using-tkinter-for-input.md) and add the ability to collect the user's favourite colour.

You will need to:
- add a new Label
- add a new Entry
- call `.grid()` on the label and entry.
    - Be sure to adjust the row for the submit button (it needs to be moved down to the next row)
- `print` output in the `handle_submit` function.

Name the file: `favourite_colour.py`
