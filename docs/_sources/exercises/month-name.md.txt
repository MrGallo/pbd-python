# Month Name

Write a function. It will return the name of a month of the year,
given the month number, according to the table below. Make sure you
**do not** put any input or output statements in the function;
the month number will be *passed in* by the `main` function and the string containing the name will be *returned* back to the `main` function.

| Number | Month |
| - | - |
| 1 |January |
| 2 |February |
| 3 |March |
| 4 |April |
| 5 |May |
| 6 |June |
| 7 |July |
| 8 |August |
| 9 |September |
| 10 | October |
| 11 | November |
| 12 | December |
| anything else | error|


The function **must** be called `month_name()`,
and must have one parameter (an `int`), and return a
`str`.

And finally, here's some starter code.

* [101_month_name.py](../_static/examples/101_month_name.py)

Final result
------------
```
Month 1: January
Month 2: February
Month 3: March
Month 4: April
Month 5: May
Month 6: June
Month 7: July
Month 8: August
Month 9: September
Month 10: October
Month 11: November
Month 12: December
Month 43: error

```
