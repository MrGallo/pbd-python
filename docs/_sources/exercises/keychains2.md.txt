```

* You will need 2 new variables in main, one to store the
 current number of keychains, and one to store the price per
 keychain.

 * The price should be `$10` per keychain.

 * `add_keychains()` will need to be passed one `int`, and have a
 return type of `int`. It will ask the user for the number of keychains
 to add to the order, and then return the new number of keychains.

 * `remove_keychains()` will need to be passed one `int`, and
 have a return type of `int`. It will ask the user for the number
 of keychains to remove from the order, and then return the new
 number of keychains.

 * `view_order()` will need to be passed two `int`s, and have a
 return type of `None`. It will display, on three different lines,
 the number of keychains in the order, the price per keychain,
 and the total cost of the order.

 * `checkout()` will need to be passed two `int`s, and have a
 return type of `None`. It will ask the user for his/her name in
 order to deliver them correctly, display the order information,
 and then thank the user, by name, for ordering.
