# Copying Lists

Write a program that creates a list of ten integers. It should
put ten random numbers from `1` to `100` in the list. It should copy all
the elements of that list into another list of the same size. Then
display the contents of both lists. To get the output to look like
mine, you'll need a several `for` loops.


* Create a list of ten integers
* Fill the list with ten random numbers (`1-100`)
* Copy the list into another list of the same capacity
* Change the last value in the first list to a `-7`
* Display the contents of both lists


```
List 1: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 -7
List 2: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 50
```

What you should do
------------------
1. Find out and explain why you can't copy a list by doing something like this:
    ```python
    list1 = [5, 6, 7, 8]
    list2 = list1
    ```
