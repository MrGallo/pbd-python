# Getting More Data from a File


Using Notepad or the text editor of your choice, create a text
file containing five names and five ages. Save this file in your home
directory.

Make a class to store information about a person:

![Person UML](examples/uml-person.png)


Create a list of five `Person` objects.

Ask the user for the name of a file to open, and open that file and read in five names and ages from the file.


Display the contents of the list using a loop.

```
Which file to open: nameage.txt
Reading data from nameage.txt

Steve Jobs is 50
James Brown is 71
Britney Spears is 23
Michael Jackson is 46
Stanley Kubrick is 76
```
