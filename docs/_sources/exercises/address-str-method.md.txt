# Address str Method


If you print out an object directly, you will get a rather confusing output. Let's give our `Address` class the ability to show us a better string representation of whatever `Address` obejct we we want to print. 

We will create a magic-method (dunder method) called `__str__` for the `Address` class that will return the string we want to show when we print the object.

What You Should Do on Your Own
------------------------------
Assignments turned in *without* these things will receive
half credit or less.

1. What happens if the function is renamed from `__str__` to something else? Answer in a comment, then change it back.
2. The `__str__` method given does not include the `state` field. Fix it so that it does.
3. What is `self` parameter that you see in the `__str__` method?
