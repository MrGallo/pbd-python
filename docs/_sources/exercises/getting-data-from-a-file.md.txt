Using Notepad or the text editor of your choice, create a text file containing six pieces of information (the breed, age, weight for two dogs). Save this file in your home directory.

Create two `Dog` objects (not in a list).

Ask the user for the name of a file to open, and open that file and read in the breed, age, weight, and breed, age, weight from the file.

Display the values you read in.

Name your program `getting_data_from_a_file.py`

```
Which file to open: dogs.txt
Reading data from dogs.txt

First dog: Yorkie, 4, 14
Second dog: Great Dane, 7, 93

```
