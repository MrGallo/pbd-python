# Picture Menu

In this program, you'll see how to call functions. Functions
are chunks of code with a name, and "calling" a function means
to have the function to do its task for you.


## Files Needed

```eval_rst
* :download:`picture_menu.py <examples/picture_menu.py>`
```


What You Should See
-------------------

```
1. Butterfly
2. Elephant
3. Teddy Bear
4. Snake

Which animal to draw? 1

```

What You Should Do on Your Own
------------------------------
Assignments turned in *without* these things will receive
no credit.

1. Add the two missing function calls for menu options 3 and 4.
2. Change the code in the `if` statement for choice 1 so that it calls the 'butterfly' function twice instead of just once. What happens now when you run the program and choose option 1? (Answer in a comment right underneath where you added the extra function call.)
