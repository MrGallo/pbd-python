# Shorter Double Dice


Redo the [Dice Doubles](dice-doubles.md) assignment (the
dice program with a loop) so that it uses a post-test "while-true-break"
loop instead of a regular `while` loop. Other than that it should
behave exactly the same.

If you do this correctly, there should be less code in this version.

Name your file: `shorter_double_dice.py`

```
HERE COME THE DICE!

Roll #1: 3
Roll #2: 5
The total is 8!

Roll #1: 6
Roll #2: 1
The total is 7!

Roll #1: 2
Roll #2: 5
The total is 7!

Roll #1: 1
Roll #2: 1
The total is 2!

```

Frequently-Asked Questions
--------------------------

- Why should we use a post-test "while-true-then-break" loop when a regular `while` loop will do?
    - It just cleans up the code a bit by reducing repeated code (which is a pattern you want to reduce whenever possible). See [the DRY principal article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
