# Is It There or Not?

Create a list and place in it ten random values from `1-50`. Display those values on the screen, and then prompt the user for an integer. Search through the list, and if the item is present, say so. If the value is not in the list, display a single message saying so. Just like the previous assignment, if the value is present more than once, you may display the message as many times as necessary.

Name your file `there_or_not.py`

```
List: 45 39 32 12 44 50 26 42 16 20
Value to find: 42

42 is in the list.
```

```
List: 45 39 32 12 44 50 26 42 16 20
Value to find: 43

43 is not in the list.
```
