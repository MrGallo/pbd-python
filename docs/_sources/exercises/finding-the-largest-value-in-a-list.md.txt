# Finding the Largest Value in a List


Write a program that creates a list to hold random numbers from `1` to `100`. Display the values in the list on the screen. Then use a linear search to find the largest value in the list, and display that value.

```
Array: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 50

The largest value is 93
```
