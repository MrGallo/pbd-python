# A Little Puzzle

Open a file specified by the user. This file will contain a bunch
of characters. You should read in *each* character from the file,
one character at a time. Display every third character on the screen.
Throw the other characters away.


There is a sample input file called [puzzle.txt](../_static/examples/puzzle.txt), containing a little message you can use to test your program.

For fun, the "thrown-away" characters might say something, too, in
case you care to try to view them somehow.

Name your program `puzzle.py`


* [puzzle.txt](../_static/examples/puzzle.txt)
* [puzzle2.txt](../_static/examples/puzzle2.txt)


```
Open which file: puzzle2.txt

# The secret message should appear here...
```

Each file contains three messages. Can you display all three but use *only one* loop?
