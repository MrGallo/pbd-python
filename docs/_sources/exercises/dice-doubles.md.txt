# Dice Doubles


Modify your dice game from last time so that it keeps rolling
until they get doubles (the same number on both dice).


Notice that since there's no user input, this will happen very
quickly (all the rolls will happen one right after the other).

Name your file: `dice_doubles.py`

```
HERE COMES THE DICE!

Roll #1: 3
Roll #2: 5
The total is 8!

Roll #1: 6
Roll #2: 1
The total is 7!

Roll #1: 2
Roll #2: 5
The total is 7!

Roll #1: 1
Roll #2: 1
The total is 2!

```
