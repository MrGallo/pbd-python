# Displaying Some Multiples

Write a program to calculate the multiples of a given number. Have the user enter a number, and then use a `for` loop to display all the multiples of that number from `1` to `12`. It is not necessary to use a function.

You *must* use a `for` loop.

Name the file `multiples.py`

```
Choose a number: 7

7x1 = 7
7x2 = 14
7x3 = 21
7x4 = 28
7x5 = 35
7x6 = 42
7x7 = 49
7x8 = 56
7x9 = 63
7x10 = 70
7x11 = 77
7x12 = 84
```
