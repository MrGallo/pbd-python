# Counting Machine

Write a program that gets an integer from the user. Count from `0`
to that number. Use a `for` loop to do it.

Name the file `counting_machine.py`

```
Count to: 19
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
```

```
Count to: 8
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```

```
Count to: 25
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25
```
