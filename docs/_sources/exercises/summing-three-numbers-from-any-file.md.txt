# Summing Three Numbers from Any File


Create several more files in Notepad containing three integers
separated by some whitespace. Save them in your folder as
`3nums1.txt`, `3nums2.txt`, `3nums3.txt`, etc.


Then write a program that asks the user which file to open. Then 
it should open that file, and read the three integers from the file.
It should then display (on the screen) the total of the integers.

Name your program `sum_from_any_file.py`

```
Which file would you like to read numbers from: 3nums2.txt
Reading numbers from file "3nums2.txt"

6 + 3 + 3 = 12

```

 



```
Which file would you like to read numbers from: 3nums4.txt
Reading numbers from file "3nums4.txt"

7 + 2 + 5 = 14

```
