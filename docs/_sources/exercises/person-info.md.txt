# Person Info

Get the starter code to run. You should see:

```
The person's name is Johnny Smitherson.
They are ?? years old.
Their hair is ????.
```

```eval_rst
* :download:`person_info.py <examples/person_info.py>`
```

What you should do
------------------
1. What happens when you change the single quotes in the f-string to double quotes? i.e., `{person["name"]}`. Why might this be the case? Respond in a comment above that line.
2. Show the `age` and `hair_color` from the dictionary as well.
3. Add into the dictionary information about this person's `"favourite_food"`. You may set the value to anything. Show this in the output as well.
