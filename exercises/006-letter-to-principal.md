```
+---------------------------------------------------------+
|                                                    #### |
|                                                    #### |
|                                                    #### |
|                                                         |

Frequently-Asked Questions
--------------------------
- Does my letter have to look exactly like yours?
    - No, but it does have to look roughly like a letter, including the box around the outside and the stamp.
- How to I get a `|` to show up on the screen?
    - The `|` character is called a "pipe". Assuming you are using a normal US keyboard, it is Shift + backslash (`\`). The backslash key is usually located between the Backspace and Enter keys.
- Why doesn't my letter line up when I run the
 program?!? Everything looks perfect in the code!
    - You probably used a mixture of tabs and spaces between the quotes in your `print()` functions. Many text editors / IDEs will only move the cursor 4 spaces when you press TAB. But when your program runs, any tabs embedded inside the quotes will take up 8 spaces, not 4. If you delete ALL the tabs between the quotes and replace them with spaces, things should look the same in your code and when you run the program.
