# Keep Guessing


Modify your previous [number-guessing game](a-number-guessing-game.html)
so that they can guess **until** they get it right. That means
it will keep looping as long as the guess is different from the secret number.
Use a `while` loop.



```
I have chosen a number between 1 and 10. Try to guess it.
Your guess: 5
That is incorrect. Guess again.
Your guess: 4
That is incorrect. Guess again.
Your guess: 8
That is incorrect. Guess again.
Your guess: 6
That's right! You're a good guesser.

```


```



```
