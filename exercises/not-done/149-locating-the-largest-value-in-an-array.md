# Locating the Largest Value in an Array


Write a program that creates an array which can hold ten values.
Fill the array with random numbers from 1 to 100. Display the values in
the array on the screen. Then use a linear search to find the largest
value in the array, and display that value **and its slot
number**.



```
Array: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 50

The largest value is 93
It is in slot 4

```


```



```
