# Fortune Cookie


Write a program that simulates a random fortune from a fortune cookie.
You must have at least six fortunes.


For bonus points, also add randomly-chosen lotto numbers to the
fortune. In Texas, the lotto chooses 6 numbers, each from 1-54.



```
Fortune cookie says: "You will find happiness with a new love."

```

Bonus output:



```
Fortune cookie says: "Stick with your wife."
    13 - 44 - 19 - 37 - 29 - 17

```


```



```
