# Shorter Double Dice


Redo the [Dice Doubles](dice-doubles.html) assignment (the
dice program with a loop) so that it uses a `do-while`
loop instead of a `while` loop. Otherwise it should
behave exactly the same.


If you do this correctly, there should be less code in this version.



```
HERE COME THE DICE!

Roll #1: 3
Roll #2: 5
The total is 8!

Roll #1: 6
Roll #2: 1
The total is 7!

Roll #1: 2
Roll #2: 5
The total is 7!

Roll #1: 1
Roll #2: 1
The total is 2!

```

Frequently-Asked Questions
--------------------------



What is a `do-while` loop?
 I don't have a good explanation written up. You'll
 have to [ask the Internet](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=do+while+loop+java).
 I'm sorry.
