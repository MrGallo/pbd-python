# Counting Machine Revisited


Write a program that gets three integers from the user. Count from
the first number to the second number in increments of the third number.
Use a `for` loop to do it.



```
Count from: 4
Count to  : 13
Count by  : 3

4 7 10 13

```

 



```
Count from: 5
Count to  : 20
Count by  : 5

5 10 15 20

```

 



```
Count from: 2
Count to  : 10
Count by  : 1

2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

```


```



```
