# Giving an Array a Bunch of Values at Once


We're going to learn how to easily give starting values
to an array when creating it! (These are called "array
initializers".)


Download the provided code, and get it to compile.


## Files Needed


* [GivingAnArrayABunchOfValuesAtOnce.java](examples/GivingAnArrayABunchOfValuesAtOnce.java)


What You Should See
-------------------



```
The first array is filled with the following values:
	alpha bravo charlie

```

After you add in the code you're supposed to, you should
see something more like this:



```
The first array is filled with the following values:
	alpha bravo charlie delta echo
The second array is filled with the following values:
	11 23 37 41 53

```

What You Should Do on Your Own
------------------------------


Assignments turned in *without* these things will receive
no credit.


1. The first array only has three values in it. Add two more, for a total of five.
 - Create a second array of `int`s, and give it five starting values, too.
 - Print the second array.





```



```
