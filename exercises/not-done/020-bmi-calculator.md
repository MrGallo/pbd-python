# BMI Calculator


(This assignment was suggested by Joel H in 2012.)


The body mass index (BMI) is commonly used by health and nutrition professionals
to estimate human body fat in populations.


It is computed by taking the individual's weight (mass) in kilograms and dividing
it by the square of their height in meters.

```
Your height in m: 1.75
Your weight in kg: 73

Your BMI is 23.83673

```
