# Modulus Animation


In this program, you'll use a loop to draw a simple ASCII-based
animation on the screen, and you will use modulus (`%`) to
determine which frame of the animation to show. (You will learn how to
create your own loops later.)


## Files Needed


* [ModulusAnimation.java](examples/ModulusAnimation.java) - modify and turn in this one
 * [ModulusAnimationWorm.java](examples/ModulusAnimationWorm.java) - first example
 * [ModulusAnimationSymbols.java](examples/ModulusAnimationSymbols.java) - second example




What You Should See
-------------------


If you download, compile and run ModulusAnimationWorm.java
it will look roughly like this.



```
   ********

```

(It will look cooler while it's running.)


What You Should Do on Your Own
------------------------------


Assignments turned in *without* these things will receive
no credit.


1. Add several `if` statements in
 ModulusAnimation.java so that it draws a little animation of your choosing.
 You must have a minimum of eight (8) different frames of animation, and it must
 loop smoothly.



```



```
