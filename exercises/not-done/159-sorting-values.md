# Sorting an Array


Download the following code, and get it to compile.


## Files Needed


* [SortingValues.java](examples/SortingValues.java)


What You Should See
-------------------



```
before: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 50
after : 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 50

```

After you add in the code you're supposed to, you should
see something more like this:



```
before: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 50
after : 12 32 39 44 45 50 75 86 87 93

```

What You Should Do on Your Own
------------------------------


Assignments turned in *without* these things will receive
no credit.


1. Use nested loops, an if statement, and some "swapping" code
 to rearrange the values in the array so that they're in order
 from smallest to largest.



```
