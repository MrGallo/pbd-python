# Grades in an Array and a File


Prompt the user for a first and last name, and the name for a
file. Randomly choose five grades for that person from 1 to 100 and
store them in an array that can hold five integers. Then output the first
and last name and those five grades to the specified file.



```
Name (first last): Marc Antony
Filename: ettu.txt

Here are your randomly-selected grades (hope you pass):
Grade 1: 54
Grade 2: 90
Grade 3: 18
Grade 4: 37
Grade 5: 62

Data saved in "ettu.txt".

```

Later, if you look in "ettu.txt" (or whatever you called your file), 
you should see values like this:



```
Marc Antony
54 90 18 37 62

```


```



```
