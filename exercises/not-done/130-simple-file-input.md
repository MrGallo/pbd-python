# Simple File Input


Start by creating a text file in Notepad (or Textpad) containing
your first and last name, separated by whitespace. Save it as
"name.txt".


Then write a program that opens that file and displays the two names
on the screen, with no input from the keyboard.


Then try changing the name in the file, saving it again, and running
the program again with no changes to confirm that it works.



```
Using my psychic powers (aided by reading data from the file), I have
determined that your name is Horace Mann.

```


```
