# Number Puzzles III: Armstrong Numbers


Use nested `for` loops to find all the three-digit
Armstrong numbers. Armstrong numbers are three digit numbers such
that the sum of the digits cubed is equal to the number itself.


For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because
1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153


However, 294 is not, because 2³ + 9³ + 4³ = 801 (not 294)
