# Baby Blackjack


Write a program that allows a human user to play a single hand of "blackjack"
against a dealer.


1. Pick two values from 1-10 for the player. These are the player's "cards".
 - Pick two more values from 1-10 for the dealer.
 - Whoever has the highest total is the winner.
 - There is no betting, no busting, and no hitting. Save that for real blackjack.






```
Baby Blackjack!

You drew 6 and 5.
Your total is 11.

The dealer has 7 and 3.
Dealer's total is 10.

YOU WIN!

```


```



```
