# How Old Are You?


Make a program which displays a different message depending on the
age given. Here are the possible responses:


* age is less than 16, say "You can't drive."
 * age is less than 18, say "You can't vote."
 * age is less than 25, say "You can't rent a car."
 * age is 25 or over, say "You can do anything that's legal."





Here's a sample run. Notice that a person who is under 16 will
display *three* messages, one for being under 16, one for also
being under 18, and one for also being under 25.



```
Hey, what's your name? Billy\_Corgan

Ok, Billy\_Corgan, how old are you? 17

You can't vote, Billy\_Corgan.
You can't rent a car, Billy\_Corgan.

```


```



```
