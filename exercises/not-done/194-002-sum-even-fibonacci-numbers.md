Project Euler
=============


Problem 2
---------



Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the
previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will
be:


1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...


By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do
not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

What You Should Do on Your Own
------------------------------


Assignments turned in *without* these things will not receive
any points.


1. After your program is done and working, add a comment at the
 top containing the final answer. If your program does not produce
 the correct answer in a reasonable amount of time, you will not
 receive points for this assignment.


Frequently-Asked Questions
--------------------------



"Project Euler"? What's up with that?
 [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/about) is a site
 of challenging math-based problems. The easiest problems (like this one!)
 have been solved by more than 100,000 people. The most difficult (ex:
 [The Silver Dollar Game](https://projecteuler.net/problem=344))
 have been solved by only about one hundred people worldwide.

 How do I know if my solution is correct?
 The easiest way is to [create
 an account](https://projecteuler.net/register) on the Project Euler website. Then you can check your
 answers and keep track of your progress.
 
 There are hundreds of Project Euler problems but you only have a few
 in the assignment list. Will I get points for solving the others?
 Of course. When you turn in a correct solution I will determine a
 fair number of points for it.
 
 How many Project Euler problems have you solved, Mr. Mitchell?
 As of November 2012 I have solved 47 problems (1-45, 48 & 67).
 That puts me in the top 9% of participants on the site.
