# Parallel Arrays


Create three arrays to store data about five people. The
first array should be `String`s and should hold
their last names. The next array should be `double`s
and should hold a grade average (on a 100-point scale). The last array
should be `int`s, should hold their student id
numbers.


Give each of the arrays values (using
[array initializers](giving-an-array-a-bunch-of-values-at-once.html)).
Then print the values of all three arrays on the screen.


Finally, ask the user for an ID number to lookup. Search through
the ID array until you find that ID, and then print out the values from
the same slot number of the other two arrays.



```
Values:
	Mitchell 99.5 123456
	Ortiz 78.5 813225
	Luu 95.6 823669
	Zimmerman 96.8 307760
	Brooks 82.7 827131
	
ID number to find: 307760

Found in slot 3
	Name: Zimmerman
	Average: 96.8
	ID: 307760

```


```
