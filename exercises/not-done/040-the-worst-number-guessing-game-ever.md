# The Worst Number-Guessing Game Ever


Write a program that plays an incredibly stupid number-guessing
game. The user will get one try to guess the secret number. Tell them
if they got it right or wrong, and if they got it wrong, display what the
secret number was.


You must store the secret number in a variable, and use that variable
throughout. The secret number itself must **not** appear in
the program at all, *except* in the one line where you store it
into a variable.


I know it will be the same number every time the game is played.
