# Refresher Challenge


This assignment is almost the same as [A Refresher](a-refresher.html).


Write a program that prompts the user for a name. Then display that
name ten times using a loop. However, if the name given is "Mitchell",
display it only five times.


So here's the challenge: write the program using only *one*
`if` statement (no `else`) and
*one* `for` loop.



```
Your name: gump

gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump

```

 



```
Your name: Mitchell

Mitchell
Mitchell
Mitchell
Mitchell
Mitchell

```


```



```
