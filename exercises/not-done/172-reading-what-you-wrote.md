# Reading What You Wrote


Again, make a record to store information about a car. It
should contain fields for:


* the make, which is a String
 * the model, which is a String
 * the year, which is an integer
 * the license-plate number, which is a String





Create an array of type `Car` with five slots. (So far,
this is the same as the previous assignment.)


Ask the user for the name of a file, and then open that file and
read all the data from that file into the array.


Finally, display the values in the array.



```
From which file do you want to load this information? cars.txt
