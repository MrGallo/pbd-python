# Safe Square Root


Write a program to take the square root of a number typed in by
the user. Your program should use a loop to ensure that the number they
typed in is positive. If the number is negative, you should print out
some sort of warning and make them type it in again.


Note that it is possible to do this program with either a
`**while**` loop or a
`**do-while**` loop. (Though personally, I think
this one is easier with a `**while**` loop.)


You can get the square root of a number `n` with
`**Math**.sqrt**(**n**)**`.
Make sure you don't do this until the loop is done and you know for
*sure* you've got a positive number.



```
SQUARE ROOT!
Enter a number: 9
The square root of 9 is 3.0.

```

 



```
SQUARE ROOT!
Enter a number: 2
The square root of 2 is 1.4142135623730951.

```

 



```
SQUARE ROOT!
Enter a number: -9
You can't take the square root of a negative number, silly.
Try again: -10
You can't take the square root of a negative number, silly.
Try again: 10
The square root of 10 is 3.1622776601683795.

```


```



```
