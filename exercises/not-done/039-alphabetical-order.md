# Alphabetical Order


Make a program that asks for the last name of the
user. Depending on their last name, make a statement about
how long they have to wait during roll call. You need to use
`else if`s to make sure only one statement
gets printed.


Once you understand how `compareTo()` works, this is a
pretty straightforward assignment, much like
[How Old Are You, specifically](how-old-are-you-elseif.html), except that it uses
`String`s instead of
`int`s and so you must use the
`compareTo**()**` method.


* name is `"Carswell"` or before: say "you don't have to wait long"
 * name is `"Jones"` or before: say "that's not bad"
 * name is `"Smith"` or before: say "looks like a bit of a wait"
 * name is `"Young"` or before: say "it's gonna be a while"
 * name is after `"Young"`: say "not going anywhere for a while?"







```
What's your last name? Stephanopolis
It's going to be a while before we get to you, "Stephanopolis".
