# Again with the Number-Guessing


Redo the [Number-Guessing with a Counter](number-guessing-with-a-counter.html)
assignment using a `do-while` loop instead
of a `while` loop. Otherwise it should do exactly the
same things (including the counter).


Make sure that it doesn't mess up if you guess it on the first try.



```
I have chosen a number between 1 and 10.  Try to guess it.
Your guess: 5
That is incorrect.  Guess again.
Your guess: 4
That is incorrect.  Guess again.
Your guess: 8
That is incorrect.  Guess again.
Your guess: 6
That's right!  You're a good guesser.
It only took you 4 tries.

```


```



```
