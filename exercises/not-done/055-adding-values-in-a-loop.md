# Adding Values in a Loop


Write a program that gets several integers from the user. Sum
up all the integers they give you. Stop looping when they enter a 0.
Display the total at the end.


You must use a `while` loop.



```
I will add up the numbers you give me.
Number: 6
The total so far is 6
Number: 9
The total so far is 15
Number: -3
The total so far is 12
Number: 2
The total so far is 14
Number: 0

The total is 14.

```
