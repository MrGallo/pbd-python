# A Little Database is Shorter with a Loop


Make a record to store information about a student,
which should handle a name, a grade classification, and an average.


Create an array of type `Student` with three slots.
Read in values for the three students and print them out again.


You must use a `for` loop.



```
U:\>java LilDatabaseLoop

Enter student 1's name: Esteban
Enter student 1's grade: 12
Enter student 1's average: 79.3

Enter student 2's name: Dave
Enter student 2's grade: 10
Enter student 2's average: 91

Enter student 3's name: Michelle
Enter student 3's grade: 11
Enter student 3's average: 98.6

The names are: Esteban Dave Michelle
The grades are: 12 10 11
The averages are: 79.3 91 98.6

```


```



```
