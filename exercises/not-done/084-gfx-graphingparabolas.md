# Graphing Parabolas


These exercises allow you to practice graphing using for loops.


## Files needed:


* [GraphPaper.java](examples/GraphPaper.java) (in case you don't already have it)
 * [GraphingParabolas.java](examples/GraphingParabolas.java) - your changes go in this one



Write code to reproduce, as accurately as possible, the following six
parabolas.


Remember that the standard form of a parabola is `y = a(x-h)² + k`  

where the vertex is at the point `(h,k)`, and the value of `a`
influences the direction and width.
