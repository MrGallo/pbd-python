# Evenness Function


Write a function like so:



```
**public static boolean** isEven**(** **int** n **)**
```

The function should return the value `**true**` if
`n` is an even number (evenly divisible by 2) and
`**false**` otherwise.


Also, write



```
**public static boolean** isDivisibleBy3**(** **int** n **)**
```

The function should return the value `**true**` if
`n` is evenly divisible by 3 and `**false**` otherwise.


Write a `main**()**` that contains a `**for**`
loop to generate all the numbers from 1 to 20. Use `**if**` statements
inside the loop to mark the number with a "<" if it's even, with a "="
if it's evenly divisible by 3, and with both if it's divisible by both 2
and 3.



```
1
2 <
3 =
4 <
5
6 <
6 =
7
8 <
9 =
10 <
11
12 <
12 =
13
14 <
15 =
16 <
17
18 <
18 =
19
20 <

```

If you're cool, it's possible to make the display like this:



```
1
2 <
3 =
4 <
5
6 <=
7
8 <
9 =
10 <
11
12 <=
13
14 <
15 =
16 <
17
18 <=
19
20 <

```


```



```
