# Keychains for Sale, real ultimate power


You're going to add some error checking and additional features,
to [Keychains2](keychains2.html).


You need to make sure that the user always has a positive
number, or 0, of keychains in the order.


You need to check for a valid menu choice. If not, display
an error message and show the menu again.


You will need 3 new variables in main, one to store the sales
tax (8.25%), one to store the shipping cost per order ($5.00), and
one to store the additional per keychain shipping cost ($1.00).


view\_order() will need to be passed the three additional
variables, a total of five, and have a return type of void. It will
display, on different lines, the number of keychains in the order,
the price per keychain, the shipping charges on the order, the
subtotal before tax, the tax on the order, and the final cost of
the order.


view\_order() might look like public static void
view\_order( int num\_keychains, double price\_per\_keychain, double tax,
int base\_shipping, int per\_keychain\_shipping )


checkout() will need to be passed the same values as
view\_order(), and have a return type of void. It will ask the
user for his/her name in order to deliver them correctly, then call
view\_order() to display the order information, and then thank the
user, by name, for ordering.
