# Basic ArrayLists 1


Create an ArrayList that can hold Integers. Add ten copies
of the number -113 to the ArrayList. Then display the contents
of the ArrayList on the screen.


This time, you *must* use a loop, both to fill up the
ArrayList and to display it.Also, in the condition of your loop,
you should *not* count up to a literal number. Instead you
should use the `size()` of your ArrayList.



```
Slot 0 contains a -113
Slot 1 contains a -113
Slot 2 contains a -113
Slot 3 contains a -113
Slot 4 contains a -113
Slot 5 contains a -113
Slot 6 contains a -113
Slot 7 contains a -113
Slot 8 contains a -113
Slot 9 contains a -113

```


```



```
