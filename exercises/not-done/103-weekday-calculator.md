# Weekday Calculator


Using the functions you wrote in previous assignments and
the leap year function provided, write a function to determine the
day of the week a person was born given his or her birthday. The
following steps should be used to find the day of the week
corresponding to any date from 1901 through the present.


In the following explanation, the following terms will be helpful.
Assuming I type in my birthday as "6 10 1981":


The *month* is 6.  

The *day of the month* is 10.  

The *year* is 1981.


1. Find the number of years since 1900, and put it into a
 variable called `yy`. Simply subtract 1900
 from the year to get this.

 - Divide the number of years since 1900 by 4. Put the
 quotient in a variable called `total`. For example, if the
 person was born in 1983, divide 83 by 4 and store 20 in
 `total`.
 
 - Also add the number of years since 1900 to
 `total`.
 
 - Add the day of the month to `total`.
 
 - Using the function `month_offset()` you wrote,
 find the "month offset" and add it to `total`.
 
 - If the year is a leap year and if the month you are working
 with is either January or February, then subtract 1 from the
 `total`. You can use the function `is_leap()`
 provided to determine if the year is a leap year.
 
 - Find the remainder when `total` is divided by 7.
 Pass this remainder to the function `weekday_name()`
 you wrote to determine the day of the week the person was born.

 - Finally, build up a single String value containing the
 whole date (day of week, month, day, year). You'll need to
 use the function `month_name()` you wrote
 to show the month name rather than its number.

 - Return that String value.










Whew. Here's some code to get you started.

Welcome to Mr. Mitchell's fantastic birth-o-meter!

All you have to do is enter your birthday, and it will tell you
the day of the week on which you were born.

Some automatic tests....
12 10 2003 => Wednesday, December 10, 2003
 2 13 1976 => Friday, February 13, 1976
 2 13 1977 => Sunday, February 13, 1977
 7  2 1974 => Tuesday, July 2, 1974
 1 15 2003 => Wednesday, January 15, 2003
10 13 2000 => Friday, October 13, 2000

Now it's your turn!  What's your birthday?
Birthday (mm dd yyyy): 11 11 2010

You were born on Thursday, November 11, 2010!
