# Basic Records


Make a record to store information about a student,
which should handle a name, a grade classification, and an average.


Create three variables of type `Student`. Read in
values for the three students and print them out again.


Give the average for all three students.


Do not use an array, and do not use any loops.



```
Enter the first student's name: Esteban
Enter the first student's grade: 12
Enter the first student's average: 79.3

Enter the second student's name: Dave
Enter the second student's grade: 10
Enter the second student's average: 91

Enter the third student's name: Michelle
