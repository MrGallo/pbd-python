# Basic Arrays 1


Create an array that can hold ten integers. Fill up each slot of
the array with the number -113. Then display the contents of the array
on the screen.


This time, you *must* use a loop, to put the values in
the array and also to display them. Also, in the condition of
your loop, you should *not* count up to a literal number.
Instead you should use the `length` field of your
array.



```
Slot 0 contains a -113
Slot 1 contains a -113
Slot 2 contains a -113
Slot 3 contains a -113
Slot 4 contains a -113
Slot 5 contains a -113
Slot 6 contains a -113
Slot 7 contains a -113
Slot 8 contains a -113
Slot 9 contains a -113

```


```



```
