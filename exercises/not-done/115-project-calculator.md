# Project: Calculator


Write a calculator program. A minimal calculator will support
the following functions:


* numbers with decimals (not just integers)
 * addition (1 + 2 is 3)
 * subtraction (12 - 4 is 8)
 * multiplication (33 * 2 is 66)
 * division (3 / 8 is 0.375)
 * exponents (2 ^ 3 is 8)
 * error messages when you do something wrong








Your calculator should keep on running until explicitly told to quit.
I suggest typing a zero as the first operand to cause it to quit, i.e.



```
>2 + 3
5
>4 * 9
36
>0 + 2
Bye, now.

```

Programs may support other features if desired. Suggested other
functions to add include:


* modulus (10 % 3 is 1)
 * factorials (4 ! is 4*3*2*1, a.k.a. 24)
 * trigonometric functions (sin,cos,tan)
 * square roots
 * negation (- -3 is 3)
 * angles in degrees or radians
 * a help feature to display legal syntax and supported functions
 * previous result used as first operand
 * the ability to store and recall results
 * rounding
 * logarithms
 * arbitrary roots
 * conversion from base 10 to binary (for integers only)














Interested students might look at the documentation for
`[java.lang.Math](http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html)`
to find help with some of the above functions. Also, some
may wonder how to deal with the first operand possibly being a
character or a number. That is, how can your program support
phrases like "2 + 3" (`double String double`) and "sin
30" (`String double`) at the same time? Well, if you
read in *everything* as a `String`, then I've
written some functions you can use to convert to other things.


* [Numeric.java](examples/Numeric.java)



```
**Numeric**.isNumeric( **String** s ) **// returns true if s is a number**
	
**Numeric**.isInteger( **String** s ) **// returns true if s is an integer**

**Numeric**.isDouble( **String** s ) **// returns true if s is a double**

**Double**.valueOf( **String** s ) **// returns the double that s represents**

**Integer**.valueOf( **String** s ) **// returns the int that s represents**

```

What to avoid
-------------


Any program which presents me with a screen like the following will
not receive a very good score.



```
Enter the function you wish to perform.
1) addition
2) subtraction
3) multiplication
4) division
5) quit
Your choice:

```

Also, the same fate applies to any program that ever presents me with
the following message:



```
 Would you like to calculate again? (y/n) 
```

Finally, you may use the built-in `Math.pow()` function in
order to compute powers, but those that write their own will receive a
much higher score.



```



```
