# Boxy


In the `paint()` method of Boxy1, write code to draw
four (4) colored boxes on the screen. Each box should be 100 pixels
wide and 100 pixels high. Draw each box in a different color and draw
them at different places on the screen. It is okay if some of the boxes
overlap.


The first box is done for you.
