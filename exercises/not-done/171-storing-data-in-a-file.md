# Storing Data in a File


Make a record to store information about a car. It should contain
fields for:


* the make, which is a string
 * the model, which is a string
 * the year, which is an integer
 * the license-plate number, which is a string





Create an array of type `Car` with five slots. Have
the user type in values to fill up the array.


Ask the user for the name of a file, and then open that file and
output all the data from the array to that file.


Use Notepad or some other text editor to confirm that the data
is correctly in the file. Be careful to only put *data* in the
file, and not labels.

After you have run the program, the file cars.txt (or whatever you called it)
should look like this:

Honda Civic 1993 883-RS9
Ford Mustang 1966 AZUCAR
