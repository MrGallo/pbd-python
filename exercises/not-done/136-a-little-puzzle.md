# A Little Puzzle


Note: This Assignment is somewhat broken. Using Scanner, you can't read a single
character from a file.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Open a file specified by the user. This file will contain a bunch
of characters. You should read in *each* character from the file,
one character at a time. Display every third character on the screen.
Throw the other characters away.


There is a sample input file called
[puzzle.txt](examples/puzzle.txt), containing a
little message you can use to test your program.


For fun, the "thrown-away" characters might say something, too, in
case you care to try to view them somehow.


* [puzzle.txt](examples/puzzle.txt)* [puzzle2.txt](examples/puzzle2.txt)




```
Open which file: puzzle2.txt

This\_is\_the\_right\_message\_from\_sample2.txt

```


```



```
