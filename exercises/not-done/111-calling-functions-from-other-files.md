# Calling Functions from Other Files


Rewrite the [Weekday Calculator](weekday-calculator.html)
to have almost no functions in it. Start by opening up
`WeekdayCalculator.java` and saving a copy of it as
`CallingFunctionsFromOtherFiles.java`.


Then erase all the functions except for `main**()**`
and `weekday**()**`.


Now, when you compile it, you should get a lot of errors about
undefined functions.


Then rewrite all the function calls so that they refer to versions
in your previous assignments. The functions will be these:


* `MonthName.month_name()`* `WeekdayName.weekday_name()`* `MonthOffset.month_offset()`* `WeekdayCalculator.is_leap()`






```
