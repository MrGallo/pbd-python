# Twenty Questions... well, actually just Two


Make a program which plays a simple game of ~~20~~ 2 Questions.
The first question should be "animal, vegetable, or mineral?" Then, the
second question should be "is it bigger than a breadbox?" Then, display
one of six possible responses, depending on their answers. You can
choose what answers to give for each of the six possibilities.


Here's a suggestion:




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| size \ type  animal vegetable mineral
 | smaller than a breadbox squirrel carrot paper clip
 | bigger than a breadbox moose watermelon Camaro
 | | | |
 | | | |
 | | | |


You will use *nested* `**if**`
statements to do this.



```
TWO QUESTIONS!
Think of an object, and I'll try to guess it.

Question 1) Is it animal, vegetable, or mineral?
> animal

Question 2) Is it bigger than a breadbox?
> no

My guess is that you are thinking of a mouse.
I would ask you if I'm right, but I don't actually care.
