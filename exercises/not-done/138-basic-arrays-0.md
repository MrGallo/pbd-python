# Basic Arrays 0


Create an array that can hold ten integers. Fill up each slot of
the array with the number -113. Then display the contents of the array
on the screen.


*Do not* use a loop. Also, do not use any variable for the index;
you must use literal numbers to refer to each slot.



```
Slot 0 contains a -113
Slot 1 contains a -113
Slot 2 contains a -113
Slot 3 contains a -113
Slot 4 contains a -113
Slot 5 contains a -113
Slot 6 contains a -113
Slot 7 contains a -113
Slot 8 contains a -113
Slot 9 contains a -113

```


```



```
