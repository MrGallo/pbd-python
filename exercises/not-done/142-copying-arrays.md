# Copying Arrays


Write a program that creates an array of ten integers. It should
put ten random numbers from 1 to 100 in the array. It should copy all
the elements of that array into another array of the same size. Then
display the contents of both arrays. To get the output to look like
mine, you'll need a several `for` loops.


* Create an array of ten integers
 * Fill the array with ten random numbers (1-100)
 * Copy the array into another array of the same capacity
 * Change the last value in the first array to a -7
 * Display the contents of both arrays







```
Array 1: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 -7
Array 2: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 50

```


```



```
