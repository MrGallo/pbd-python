# Finding a Value in an Array


Create an array that can hold ten integers, and fill each slot
with a different random value from 1-50. Display those values on the
screen, and then prompt the user for an integer. Search through the
array, and if the item is present, say so. It is not necessary to
display anything if the value was not found. If the item is in the array
multiple times, it's okay if the program prints the message more than
once.



```
Array: 45 39 32 12 44 50 26 42 16 20
Value to find: 42

42 is in the array.

```

 



```
Array: 45 39 32 12 44 50 26 42 16 20
Value to find: 43

```

 



```
Array: 24 30 31 24 32 33 34 24 35 36
Value to find: 24

24 is in the array.
24 is in the array.
24 is in the array.

```


```



```
