# compareTo() Challenge


Write a program that compares several
`**String**`s using the
`compareTo**()**` method. You should display
the `**String**`s and display the integer
that `compareTo**()**` gives you.


You must have five examples which result in a number less than 0,
five examples which result in a number greater than 0, and two
examples which give you exactly 0. This means you need a total of
twelve examples.


You may **not** just flip the
`**String**`s around; you
must have twelve *different* examples.


Here's an example:



```
**System**.out.print**(****"Comparing \"axe\" with \"dog\" produces "****)**;
**int** i = **"axe"**.compareTo**(****"dog"****)**;
**System**.out.println**(**i**)**;

**System**.out.print**(****"Comparing \"applebee's\" with \"apple\" produces "****)**;
**System**.out.println**(** **"applebee's"**.compareTo**(****"apple"****)** **)**;

```


```
Comparing "axe" with "dog" produces -3
Comparing "applebee's" with "apple" produces 5

```


```



```
