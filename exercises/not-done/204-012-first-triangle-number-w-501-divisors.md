----------------------------------

Difficulty rating: 5%### Problem 12



The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first ten terms would be:


1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...


Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:



> **1**: 1  
> 


We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.


What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred divisors?
