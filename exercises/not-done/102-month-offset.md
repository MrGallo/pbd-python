# Month Offset


Write a function to give you the "month offset" given a number
representing the month. You can get the month offset from the following
table:




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Month Month offset
| 1 1
| 2 4
| 3 4
| 4 0
| 5 2
| 6 5
| 7 0
| 8 3
| 9 6
| 10 1
| 11 4
| 12 6
| anything else -1
 | |
 | |
 | |
 | |
 | |
 | |
 | |
 | |
 | |
 | |
 | |
 | |
 | |
 | |




Of course, here's the main() to test your function.
