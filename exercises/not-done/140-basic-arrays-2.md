# Basic Arrays 2


Create an array that can hold ten integers. Fill up each slot of
the array with a random number from 1 to 100. Then display the contents
of the array on the screen. You must use a loop.


And, like last time, you must use the `length`
field of your array and not a literal number (like 10) in the
condition of the loop.



```
Slot 0 contains a 45
Slot 1 contains a 87
Slot 2 contains a 39
Slot 3 contains a 32
Slot 4 contains a 93
Slot 5 contains a 86
Slot 6 contains a 12
Slot 7 contains a 44
Slot 8 contains a 75
Slot 9 contains a 50

```


```



```
