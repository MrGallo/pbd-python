# How Old Are You, Specifically?


Using `if` statements, `else if`,
and `else` statements, make a program which displays
a different message depending on the age given.




|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| age  message
| less than 16  `"You can't drive."`| 16 to 17  `"You can drive but not vote."`| 18 to 24  `"You can vote but not rent a car."`| 25 or older  `"You can do pretty much anything."` | |
 | |
 | |
 | |
 | |


Note that unlike the [original "How
Old Are You" assignment](how-old-are-you.html), this program must only display
*exactly one* message for a given age and not multiple messages.



```
Hey, what's your name? (Sorry, I keep forgetting.) Billy\_Corgan
Ok, Billy\_Corgan, how old are you? 17

You can drive but you can't vote, Billy\_Corgan.

```

 



```
Hey, what's your name? (Sorry, I keep forgetting.) Billy\_Corgan
Ok, Billy\_Corgan, how old are you? 14

You can't drive, Billy\_Corgan.

```

You can make up your own messages if you want, but you must have
at least four messages, and you must use `else if`
statements to make sure only one of the messages is printed for any
given age.



```



```
