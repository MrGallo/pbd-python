# Simple Web Input


In Java, reading text from a web page isn't much more difficult than reading
from a text file! Download the following code and get it to compile.


## Files Needed


* [SimpleWebInput.java](examples/SimpleWebInput.java)



```
**import** java.net.URL;
**import** java.util.**Scanner**;

**public class** SimpleWebInput
**{**
    **public static void** main**(****String****[]** args**)** **throws** **Exception**
    **{**
        URL mcool = **new** URL**(****"http://cs.leanderisd.org/mitchellis.txt"****)**;
        **Scanner** webIn = **new** **Scanner****(** mcool.openStream**() )**;

        **String** one = webIn.nextLine**()**;
        
        webIn.close**()**;
        
        **System**.out.println**(**one**)**;
    **}**
**}**

```

What You Should See

Mr. Mitchell is cool.

What You Should Do on Your Own
------------------------------


Assignments turned in *without* these things will receive
half credit or less.


1. The code provided only reads a single line from the URL given,
 but `mitchellis.txt` contains two lines. Add in code
 to read in and display the second line as well.
 - Once that works, change the URL to read text from a different web location.
