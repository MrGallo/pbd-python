# Twenty Questions... well, actually just Two


Make a program which plays a simple game of ~~`20`~~ `2` Questions.

The first question should be `"animal, vegetable, or mineral?"` Then, the second question should be `"is it bigger than a breadbox?"` Then, display one of six possible responses, depending on their answers. You can choose what answers to give for each of the six possibilities.

Here's a suggestion:

|  | animal | vegetable | mineral |
| - | - | - | - |
| **smaller than a breadbox** | squirrel | carrot | paper clip
| **bigger than a breadbox** | moose | watermelon | Camaro


You will use *nested* **`if`** statements to do this.

Name your file: `032_two_questions.py`

```
TWO QUESTIONS!
Think of an object, and I'll try to guess it.

Question 1) Is it animal, vegetable, or mineral?
> animal

Question 2) Is it bigger than a breadbox?
> no

My guess is that you are thinking of a mouse.
