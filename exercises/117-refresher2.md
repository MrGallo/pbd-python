# Refresher Challenge


This assignment is almost the same as [A Refresher](116-a-refresher.md).


Write a program that prompts the user for a name. Then display that name ten times using a loop. However, if the name given is `"Harambe"`, display it only five times.

So here's the challenge: write the program using only *one* `if` statement (no `else`) and only *one* `for` loop.

Name the file `117_refresher2.py`

```
Your name: gump

gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump
gump

```

 



```
Your name: Harambe

Harambe
Harambe
Harambe
Harambe
Harambe

```
