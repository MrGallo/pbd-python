# Fortune Cookie


Write a program that simulates a random fortune from a fortune cookie. You must have at least six fortunes.

For bonus points, also add randomly-chosen lotto numbers to the
fortune. In Texas, the lotto chooses 6 numbers, each from 1-54.

Name your file: `044_fortune_cookie.py`

```
Fortune cookie says: "You will find happiness with a new love."
```

Bonus output:
```
Fortune cookie says: "Stick with your wife."
    13 - 44 - 19 - 37 - 29 - 17

```
