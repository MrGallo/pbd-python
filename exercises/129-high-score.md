# High Score


Write a little program that asks the user for their name and their high score. Then store that name and that "high score" in a file. The file should be called "score.txt".

The score should be overwritten, not appended.

Name your program `129_high_score.py`

```
You got a high score!

Please enter your score: 32767
Please enter your name: Mitchell
Data stored into score.txt.

```
