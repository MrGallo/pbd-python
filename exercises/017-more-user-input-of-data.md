# More User Input of Data

Ask the user for several pieces of information, and display them
on the screen afterward as a summary.

* first name
* last name
* grade
* student id number
* login name
* average (0.0 to 100.0)

You must use the most appropriate type for each variable and not just strings for everything.

The spacing of the output text isn't terribly important, but please do get all user input on the same line as the prompt.

Name the file:

`017_more_user_input.py`

```
