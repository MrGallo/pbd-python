# Finding a Value in a List


Create a list with ten random values from `1-50`. Display those values on the screen, and then prompt the user for an integer. Search through the
list, and if the item is present, say so. It is not necessary to
display anything if the value was not found. If the item is in the list
multiple times, it's okay if the program prints the message more than
once.

Do not use any built-in methods like `list.index()` or the `in` operator. Use a loop to manually search the list.

Name your file `144_find_value_in_list.py`

```
List: 45 39 32 12 44 50 26 42 16 20
Value to find: 42

42 is in the list.
```

```
List: 45 39 32 12 44 50 26 42 16 20
Value to find: 43
```

```
List: 24 30 31 24 32 33 34 24 35 36
Value to find: 24

24 is in the list.
24 is in the list.
24 is in the list.
```
