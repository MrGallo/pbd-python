# A Silly Calculator

Make a simple numeric calculator. It should prompt the user for three numbers. Then add the numbers together and divide by `2`. Display the result. Your program must support numbers with decimals and not just integers.

Name the file:

`019_silly_calculator.py`

```
What is your first number? 1.1
What is your second number? 2.2
What is your third number? 5.5

( 1.1 + 2.2 + 5.5 ) / 2 is... 4.4
```
