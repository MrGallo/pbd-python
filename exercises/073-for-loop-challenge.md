# For Loop Challenge

Get a blank sheet of paper (scratch paper is fine) and something
to write with. Tell your teacher you'd like to take the **For
Loop Challenge**. They will ask you to write an arbitrary
`for` loop on the sheet of paper. If you do it without
any mistakes, you will receive full points.


You may take this challenge more than once, but you'll receive 5 fewer
points each time you do it. The `for` loop you must
write will be different each time.


Here's an example of what you'll be asked to do:

> "Write a for loop that prints out all the numbers from {start} to {end} counting by {increment}

> "Write a for loop that prints out all the numbers from 15 to 30, counting by 3s"

# Bonus

If you feel like you are up for a greater challenge you can offer to sum up the numbers, or sum up certain multiples as you print out the numbers.
