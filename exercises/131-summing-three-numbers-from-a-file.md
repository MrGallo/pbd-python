# Summing Three Numbers from a File

First, create a file in Notepad containing three integers separated
by some whitespace. Save it as `3nums.txt` in the same folder
as your code.

Then write a program that reads three integers from the file
`3nums.txt` and displays (on the screen) the total of the
integers.

Name your program `131_sum_from_file.py`

```
Reading numbers from file "3nums.txt"... done.

3 + 1 + 4 = 8

```
