# Weekday Name

I have provided a function that is supposed to return the name of a day of the week given the day number.

## Files Needed
* [weekday_name.py](examples/weekday_name.py)

Use `if`, `elif` and `else` to complete it according to the following table:

| Number | Weekday Name |
| - | - |
|0| Monday |
|1| Tuesday |
|2| Wednesday |
|3| Thursday |
|4| Fiday |
|5| Saturday |
|6| Sunday |
|anything else| error

Save your solution as:

`024_weekday_name.py`
