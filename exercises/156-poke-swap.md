What You Should Do on Your Own
------------------------------
Assignments turned in *without* these things will receive
no credit.

1. Write code where indicated that exchanges Pikachu (index 0)
 with Gyarados (index 3). Make sure the code works in such a way
 that it would still swap index 0 with index 3, no matter what values
 were in there to begin with. You'll need to create an extra string variable.
