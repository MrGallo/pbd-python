# Basic Lists 2


Create an empty List. Append ten random numbers from `1` to `100`. Then display the contents of the list on the screen. You must use a loop.

And, like last time, you must use the `len()` function and not a literal number (like `10`) in loop `range`.

Name the file `140_list2.py`

```
Slot 0 contains a 45
Slot 1 contains a 87
Slot 2 contains a 39
Slot 3 contains a 32
Slot 4 contains a 93
Slot 5 contains a 86
Slot 6 contains a 12
Slot 7 contains a 44
Slot 8 contains a 75
Slot 9 contains a 50
```
