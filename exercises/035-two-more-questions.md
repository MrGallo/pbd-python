# Two More Questions

Using `if` statements with compound conditions
(like `and`), make a guessing game of two questions
similar to the [Twenty Questions
assignment](032-twenty-questions.md).


However, this time you *must* accomplish it using `if` statements with compound conditions and **you *must
not* use `elif` or `else` or nested `if`s**.


* Question 1: Does it belong inside or outside or both?
* Question 2: Is it alive?

Again, here are some sample responses, for the non-creative among
you.


|  | inside | outside | both |
| - | - | - | - |
| **alive** | houseplant | bison | dog |
| **not alive** | shower curtain | billboard | cell phone |

Name your file: `035_two_more_questions.py`

```
TWO MORE QUESTIONS, BABY!

Think of something and I'll try to guess it!

Question 1) Does it stay inside or outside or both? outside
Question 2) Is it a living thing? yes

Then what else could you be thinking of besides a python?!?

Obviously the nonliving, inside/outside thing on your mind is a dead ant!
