# Simple File Reading


Start by creating a text file in Notepad (or any other text editor) containing your first and last name, separated by whitespace. Save it as
`name.txt`.


Then write a program that opens that file and displays the two names
on the screen, with no input from the keyboard.

Name your program `130_simple_file_read.py`

Then try changing the name in the file, saving it again, and running
the program again. Confirm that it works and is properly reading the file with the new name.



```
Using my psychic powers (aided by reading data from the file),
I have determined that your name is Horace Mann.
```
