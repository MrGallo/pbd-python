# Xs and Ys


Write another program that uses a `for` loop. With the loop,
make the variable `x` go from `-10` to `10`, counting by `0.5`.
(This means that `x` can't be an `int`.)


Inside the body of the loop, make another variable `y` 
become the current value of `x` squared. Then display the
current values of both `x` and `y`.


To get your output to line up like mine, use a tab (`\t`).

Name the file `069_x_y.py`

```
 x      y
-----------------
-10.0   100.00
-9.5    90.25
-9.0    81.00
-8.5   
-8.0    64.00
...
9.0     81.00
9.5     90.25
10.0    100.00

```
