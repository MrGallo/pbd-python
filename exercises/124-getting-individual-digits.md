# Getting Individual Digits


Use nested `for` loops to generate a list of all
the positive two digit numbers. Display the numbers, and the sums
of their digits.

Name the file `124_individual_digits.py`

```
10, 1+0 = 1
11, 1+1 = 2
12, 1+2 = 3
13, 1+3 = 4
14, 1+4 = 5
15, 1+5 = 6
16, 1+6 = 7
17, 1+7 = 8
18, 1+8 = 9
19, 1+9 = 10
20, 2+0 = 2
21, 2+1 = 3
22, 2+2 = 4
...
...
...
97, 9+7 = 16
98, 9+8 = 17
99, 9+9 = 18

```


```
