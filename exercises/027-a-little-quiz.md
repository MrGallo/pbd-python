# A Little Quiz

Write an interactive quiz. It should ask the user three multiple-choice or true/false questions about something. It must keep track of how many they get wrong, and print out a "score" at the end.

Name your file:

`027_little_quiz.py`

```
Are you ready for a quiz?  N
Okay, here it comes!

Q1) What is the capital of Alaska?
	1) Melbourne
	2) Anchorage
	3) Juneau

> 3

That's right!

Q2) In Python, the way you get keyboard input is the keyobard_input function.
	1) true
	2) false

> 1

Sorry, in Python, you would use the "input" function to get keyboard input.

Q3) What is the result of 9 + 6 / 3?
	1) 5
	2) 11
	3) 15/3

> 2

That's correct!


Overall, you got 2 out of 3 correct.
Thanks for playing!
