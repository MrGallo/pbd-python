# Three Card Monte

This is the original "ball and cups" game where you try to find out which cup has the ball under it. You may play with three cups and a ball, three cards (two jacks and an ace), or three doors and a car. Basically, randomly select a cup to hide the "ball". Let the player guess which cup hides the ball. The player wins if they guess correctly.

```
You slide up to Fast Eddie's card table and plop down your cash.

He glances at you out of the corner of his eye and starts shuffling.

He lays down three cards.

Which one is the ace?

	##  ##  ##
	##  ##  ##
	1   2   3

> 2

Ha! Fast Eddie wins again! The ace was card number 3.

	##  ##  AA
	##  ##  AA
	1   2   3


```

(Note that this is basically just a number-guessing game with fancy graphics.)

You nailed it! Fast Eddie reluctantly hands over your winnings, scowling.
