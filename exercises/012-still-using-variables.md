# Still Using Variables

Write a program that stores your name and year of graduation
into variables, and displays their values on the screen.

Name the file: `012_still_variables.py`

Make sure that you use two variables, and that the variable that holds your name is the best *data type* for such a variable, and that the variable that holds the year is the best *data type* for *that* variable.

Also make sure that your variable names are good: the name of a variable should always relate to its contents.

```
My name is Juan Valdez and I'll graduate in 2022.
```

Please ensure that the values `"Juan Valdez"` and `2022` have been stored in variables before printing.


You're *doing it wrong* if your program looks like this:

```
print("My name is Juan Valdez and I'll graduate in 2022")
```

You need to be doing string interpolation with the variables or using string concatenation.
