# Using Variables

Write a program that creates three variables: an `int`,
a `float`, and a `str` (string).

Name the file: `011_using_variables.py`

Put the value `113` into the first variable, the
value `2.71828` into the second, and the value `"Computer Science"` into the third. It does not
matter what you call the variables... *this time*.

Then, display the values of these three variables on the screen (one per line) as per the example output:

```
This is room #113 
e is close to 2.71828 
I am learning a bit about Computer Science 
```

Your program *SHOULD NOT* look like this:
```
print("This is room # 113")
print("e is close to 2.71828")
print("I am learning a bit about Computer Science")
```

You *must* use three variables and *inject* them into the output string using f-strings, "dot format" or string concatenation. Your program will probably have *six* lines of code.
