# BMI Calculator

Please note that BMI "is not a true diagnostic of body fatness or of an individual’s overall health". It has severe flaws. See the article *[Is BMI an Accurate Way to Measure Body Fat?](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-bmi-an-accurate-way-to-measure-body-fat/)*.

The body mass index (BMI) is commonly used by health and nutrition professionals to estimate human body fat in populations.

It is computed by taking the individual's weight (mass) in kilograms and dividing it by the square of their height in meters.
