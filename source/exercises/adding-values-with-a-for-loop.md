# Adding Values with a For Loop

Write a program that gets an integer from the user. Add up all
the numbers from `1` to that number, and display the total.
Use a `for` loop to do it.

You have done something like this [before](adding-values-in-a-loop.md).

Name the file `sum_for_loop.py`

```
Number: 5

1 2 3 4 5
The sum is 15.

```

```
Number: 8

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
The sum is 36.

```
