# Number-Guessing with a Counter

Modify your previous [number-guessing game](keep-guessing.md)
so that they can guess until they get it right **AND**
count the number of tries it takes them to guess it.

Name the file: `guess_with_counter.py`


```
I have chosen a number between 1 and 10.  Try to guess it.
Your guess: 5
That is incorrect.  Guess again.
Your guess: 4
That is incorrect.  Guess again.
Your guess: 8
That is incorrect.  Guess again.
Your guess: 6
That's right!  You're a good guesser.
It only took you 4 tries.

```
