# Right Triangle Checker

Write a program to allow the user to enter three integers. You
must use pre-test or post-test `while`
loops to enforce that these integers are in ascending order,
though duplicate numbers are allowed.


Tell the user whether or not these integers would represent the
sides of a right triangle.

Name the file: `right_triangle_checker.py`

```
Enter three integers:
Side 1: 4
Side 2: 3
3 is smaller than 4.  Try again.
Side 2: -9
-9 is smaller than 4.  Try again.
Side 2: 5
Side 3: 1
1 is smaller than 5.  Try again.
Side 3: 5

Your three sides are 4 5 5
NO!  These sides do not make a right triangle!

```


```
Enter three integers:
Side 1: 6
Side 2: 8
Side 3: 10

Your three sides are 6 8 10
These sides *do* make a right triangle.  Yippy-skippy!

```
