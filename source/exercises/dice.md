# Dice


Write a program that simulates a dice roll by picking a random
number from `1-6` and then picking a second random number from `1-6`. Add the two values together, and display the total.

Name the file: `dice.py`

```
HERE COMES THE DICE!

Roll #1: 3
Roll #2: 5
The total is 8!

```

```
HERE COMES THE DICE!

Roll #1: 4
Roll #2: 2
The total is 6!

```
