#  Web Addresses Array


Records are nice, but they're even better when used with an array
or arraylist.


The code provided does the same as the previous assignment, but 
uses an array of records, instead of one variable for each record.


## Files Needed


* [WebAddressesArray.java](examples/WebAddressesArray.java)


What You Should See
-------------------



```
1. 191 Marigold Lane, Miami, FL  33179
2. 3029 Losh Lane, Crafton, PA  15205
3. 4939 Holt Street, Lake Worth, FL  33463
4. 2693 Hannah Street, Hickory, NC  28601
5. 4880 Carter Street, Fairview Heights, IL  62208

```

What You Should Do on Your Own
------------------------------


Assignments turned in *without* these things will receive
half credit or less.


1. The code provided counts up to `5` in the loops
 instead of using the `.length` field of the array. Fix this.

 - Also, the code provided makes an array that only holds five addresses,
 but the text file contains six. Make the array bigger, so that all six
 addresses are read in.




```
