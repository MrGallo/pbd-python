# Address toString()


If you want, you can add a `toString()`
method to a record. The function should return a `String` showing how the record should be
printed. Using a `toString()` method makes printing
records much easier.

1. What happens if the function is renamed from `toString()`
 to something else? Answer in a comment, then change it back.
