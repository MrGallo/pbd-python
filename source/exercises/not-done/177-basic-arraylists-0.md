# Basic ArrayLists 0


Create an ArrayList that can hold Integers. Add ten copies of
the number -113 to the ArrayList. Then display the contents of the ArrayList
on the screen.


*Do not* use a loop. Also, do not use any variable for the index;
you must use literal numbers to refer to each slot.



```
Slot 0 contains a -113
Slot 1 contains a -113
Slot 2 contains a -113
Slot 3 contains a -113
Slot 4 contains a -113
Slot 5 contains a -113
Slot 6 contains a -113
Slot 7 contains a -113
Slot 8 contains a -113
Slot 9 contains a -113

```


```



```
