# Graphing Lines


These exercises allow you to practice graphing using for loops. Download the following
files, and make your changes in GraphingLines.java.


## Files needed:


* [GraphPaper.java](examples/GraphPaper.java) - download this, but don't edit it
 * [GraphingLines.java](examples/GraphingLines.java) - your changes go in this one



Write code to reproduce, as accurately as possible, the following six
graphs.


Remember that the standard form of a line is `y = mx + b`  

where `m` is the slope, and `b` is the y-intercept.
