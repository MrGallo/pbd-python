# Getting More Data from a File


Using Notepad or the text editor of your choice, create a text
file containing five names and five ages. Save this file in your home
directory.


Make a record to store information about a person. It should
contain fields for:


* a single name, which is a String, and
 * an age, which is an integer



Create an array of type `Person` with five slots.


Ask the user for the name of a file to open, and open that file
and read in five names and ages from the file.


Display the contents of the array using a loop.



```
Which file to open: nameage.txt
Reading data from nameage.txt

Steve\_Jobs is 50
James\_Brown is 71
Britney\_Spears is 23
Michael\_Jackson is 46
Stanley\_Kubrick is 76

```


```



```
