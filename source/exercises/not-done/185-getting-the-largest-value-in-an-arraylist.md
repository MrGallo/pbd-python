# Getting the Largest Value in an ArrayList


Write a program that creates an ArrayList which can hold Integers.
Fill the ArrayList with random numbers from 1 to 100. Display the values in
the ArrayList on the screen. Then use a linear search to find the largest
value in the ArrayList, and display that value.



```
ArrayList: [45, 87, 39, 32, 93, 86, 12, 44, 75, 50]

The largest value is 93

```


```



```
