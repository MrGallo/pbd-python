# A Clock Face


Make a graphics program that displays the face of an
analog clock on the screen. There must be a circle containing
two "hands", one longer and one shorter. Around the inside of
the circle, you must have numeric labels at 12, 3, 6, and 9.


For extra credit, add labels for all twelve numbers.


Here is a working example version:
