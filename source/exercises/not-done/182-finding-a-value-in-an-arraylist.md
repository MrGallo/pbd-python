# Finding a Value in an ArrayList


Create an ArrayList that can hold Integers, and fill each slot
with a different random value from 1-50. Display those values on the
screen, and then prompt the user for an integer. Search through the
ArrayList, and if the item is present, say so. It is not necessary to
display anything if the value was not found. If the item is in the ArrayList
multiple times, it's okay if the program prints the message more than
once.



```
ArrayList: [45, 39, 32, 12, 44, 50, 26, 42, 16, 20]
Value to find: 42

42 is in the ArrayList.

```

 



```
ArrayList: [45, 39, 32, 12, 44, 50, 26, 42, 16, 20]
Value to find: 43


```

 



```
ArrayList: [24, 30, 31, 24, 32, 33, 34, 24, 35, 36]
Value to find: 24

24 is in the ArrayList.
24 is in the ArrayList.
24 is in the ArrayList.

```


```



```
