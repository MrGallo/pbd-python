# Web Addresses


Records are an easy way to create a single variable that
can hold several different values. For example, consider the problem
of storing a mailing address. The address has many parts, but is
conceptually one unit.


## Files Needed


* [WebAddresses.java](examples/WebAddresses.java)


I have created a text file with some [fake addresses](examples/fake-addresses.txt).
This file contains six addresses.


The code provided will create a record called "`Address`"
that contains four fields:


1. a field for the house number / street name (a `String`)
 - a field for the city name (a `String`)
 - a field for the state (a `String`)
 - a field for the zip code (an `int`)





Then, the code provided creates a variable of type `Address`
and reads the values from the first address in the text file into the four
fields of the record.


It does the same thing for a second and third address. Finally, it
prints out the three addresses on the screen.


What You Should See
-------------------



```
191 Marigold Lane, Miami, FL  33179
3029 Losh Lane, Crafton, PA  15205
4939 Holt Street, Lake Worth, FL  33463

```

What You Should Do on Your Own
------------------------------


Assignments turned in *without* these things will receive
half credit or less.


1. The code provided only creates three `Address`
 variables. Change the code to read and display two more addresses
 from the file.



```
