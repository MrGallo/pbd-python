# Sorting an ArrayList


Write a program that creates an ArrayList of Integers.
Fill the ArrayList with random numbers from 10 to 99. Display the values in
the ArrayList on the screen. Then using the sort of your choice, arrange the
values from largest to smallest and display them again.


You must put the sorting code in its own function.



```
ArrayList before: [30, 86, 19, 58, 26, 51, 50, 35, 97, 56, 43, 82, 57, 54, 40, 85, 55, 29, 76, 35]
ArrayList after : [97, 86, 85, 82, 76, 58, 57, 56, 55, 54, 51, 50, 43, 40, 35, 35, 30, 29, 26, 19]

```


```



```
