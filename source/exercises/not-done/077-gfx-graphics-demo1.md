What You Should Do on Your Own
------------------------------


Assignments turned in *without* these things will receive
half credit or less. Answer any questions in comments at the top of
`GraphicsDemo1.java`.


1. How big is the window that appears? How many pixels wide? How many pixels tall?
 - In the call to the function `g.drawRect()`, there are four numbers. What
 do they mean? Try changing them to figure it out.
 - What about the call to `fillOval()`? What do the four numbers mean here?
 - What are the two numbers in the call to `drawString()`?
 - What happens when two objects overlap? Which one is drawn on top?
 - Add a red, filled-in square somewhere in the lower-right of the canvas.
