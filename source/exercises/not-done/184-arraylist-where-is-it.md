# ArrayList - Where Is It?


Create an ArrayList that can hold Integers, and fill each slot
with a different random value from 1-50. Display those values on the
screen, and then prompt the user for an integer. Search through the
ArrayList, and if the item is present, give the slot number where it is
located. If the value is not in the ArrayList, display a single message
saying so. If the value is present more than once, you may either
display the message as many times as necessary, **or**
display a single message giving the last slot number in which it
appeared.



```
ArrayList: [45, 39, 32, 12, 44, 50, 26, 42, 16, 20]
Value to find: 42

42 is in slot 6.

```

 



```
ArrayList: [45, 39, 32, 12, 44, 50, 26, 42, 16, 20]
Value to find: 43

43 is not in the ArrayList.

```

 



```
ArrayList: [24, 30, 31, 24, 32, 33, 34, 24, 35, 36]
Value to find: 24

    *you may display either*

24 is in slot 0.
24 is in slot 3.
24 is in slot 7.

    *or*

24 is in slot 7.

```


```



```
