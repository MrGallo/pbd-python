# Getting Data from a File


Make a record to store information about a dog. It should
contain fields for:


* a breed, which is a String,
 * an age, which is an integer, and
 * a weight, which is a double




Using Notepad or the text editor of your choice, create a text
file containing six pieces of information. Save this file in your home
directory.


Create two `Dog` objects (not in an array).


Ask the user for the name of a file to open, and open that file
and read in a breed, age, weight, and breed, age, weight from the
file.


Display the values you read in.



```
Which file to open: dogs.txt
Reading data from dogs.txt

First dog: Yorkie, 4, 14
Second dog: Great\_Dane, 7, 93

```


```



```
