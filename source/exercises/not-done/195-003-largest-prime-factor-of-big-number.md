 the correct answer in a reasonable amount of time, you will not
 receive points for this assignment.


Frequently-Asked Questions
--------------------------



Does 600851475143 fit in an `int`?
 No, but it does fit in a `long`.
 Note that you will have to put an `L` after the number
 to use a long value in your Java code.

 Why does my program take *forever*?
 You are probably using a very slow method to determine if a
 number is prime. Try to speed that up!
