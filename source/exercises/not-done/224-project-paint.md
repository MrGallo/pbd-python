# Paint Program


Create an application that allows you to draw on the screen
with the mouse, similar to the "Paint" program that ships with
Windows.


200 Point Version
-----------------


This is the basic paint program. It requires the following capabilities:


* The program must use the mouse to draw lines on
 the screen, which should probably be curved as from a
 spray-paint tool. (If you really want, however, you may
 make them straight lines as from a line tool.)

 * The program uses the mouse to choose among five
 different colors, and any new drawing uses the currently
 selected color.


In case you're curious, Java knows about the following
 colors: black, blue, cyan, darkGray, gray, green, lightGray,
 magenta, orange, pink, red, white, and yellow.





250 Point Version
-----------------


The 250-point version starts with all the capabilities of the
200-point version and adds the following:


* The program must make a separation between the "canvas", where drawing is
 allowed, and the "toolbar", where drawing is not. Any drawing across the toolbar
 must not show up.


300 Point Version
-----------------


The 300-point version starts with all the capabilities of the
250-point version and adds the following:


* The program allows the selection of three different
 brush sizes. It could be said that you can draw with a pen,
 a brush, or a roller.


350 Through 500 Point Versions
------------------------------


These versions start with all the capabilities of the 300-point
version. Additional points can be earned by implementing one or more
of the features listed below. You will get fifty points for adding
each one of these features for a total possible score of 500 points.


* Draw a straight line with a visible "elastic band" approach.
 * Provide an eraser that removes portions of a drawing.
 * Draw a rectangle with a visible "elastic band" approach.
 * Draw an oval with a visible "elastic band" approach.
 * Change the color of the background window.
 * Implement a "paint bucket" tool which fills in an existing shape. (100 points)







Other interesting features which are not listed above may also
earn you extra points. Just remember that the maximum score is
500 points, regardless of the number of features that you implement.
