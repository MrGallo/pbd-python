# Sorting an ArrayList of Strings


Write a program that creates an ArrayList of Strings.
Make up ten or more random words (all lowercase) and put them
in the ArrayList in any way you choose. Display them on the
screen. Then, using the sort of your choice, arrange the words
in alphabetical order and display them again.


Just like last time, you must put the sorting code in its own function.



```
ArrayList before: [ask, not, what, your, country, can, do, for, you, but]
ArrayList after : [ask, but, can, country, do, for, not, what, you, your]

```


```



```
