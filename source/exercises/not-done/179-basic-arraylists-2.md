# Basic ArrayLists 2


Create an ArrayList of Integers. Fill up the list with
ten random numbers, each from 1 to 100.
Then display the
contents of the ArrayList on the screen.


You must use a loop to fill up the list. However, you may display it
the easy way (no loop needed) like so:



```
**System**.out.println( **"ArrayList: "** + whateverYourArrayListVariableIsCalled );

```


```
ArrayList: [45, 87, 39, 32, 93, 86, 12, 44, 75, 50]

```


```



```
