# Modulus Animation

In this program, you'll use a loop to draw a simple ASCII-based
animation on the screen, and you will use modulus (`%`) to
determine which frame of the animation to show. (You will learn how to
create your own loops later.)

## Files Needed

```eval_rst
* :download:`modulus_animation.py <examples/modulus_animation.py>` - modify this. It is the base-template.
``` 
 ```eval_rst
* :download:`modulus_animation_worm.py <examples/modulus_animation_worm.py>` - first example
``` 
 ```eval_rst
* :download:`modulus_animation_symbols.py <examples/modulus_animation_symbols.py>` - second example
``` 


Name your file:

`modulus_animation.py`


What You Should See
-------------------
If you download and run `modulus_animation_worm.py` it will look roughly like this, but bouncing back and forth.

```
   ********
```

What You Should Do on Your Own
------------------------------
Assignments turned in *without* these things will receive
no credit.

1. Add several `if` and `elif` statements in
 `modulus_animation.py` so that it draws a little animation of your choosing.
2. You must have a minimum of eight (8) different frames of animation, and it must loop smoothly.
