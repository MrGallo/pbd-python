# Bubble Sort


Flesh out the following code so that it sorts the array using a bubble sort. The algorithm is very similar to the exchange sort.


You should probably read this [visualization of bubble sort](http://www.algolist.net/Algorithms/Sorting/Bubble_sort).


```eval_rst
* :download:`bubble_sort.py <examples/bubble_sort.py>`
```

```
before: 45 87 39 32 93 86 12 44 75 50
after : 12 32 39 44 45 50 75 86 87 93

```
