# More Number Puzzles


Use nested `for` loops to generate a list of all
the two digit numbers which are less than or equal to fifty-six,
and the sum of whose digits is greater than ten.


Use another set of nested `for` loops to find
a two-digit number such that the number itself minus the number
reversed is equal to the sum of its digits.


For example, 72 is not such a number because 72-27 (which is 45)
is **not** the same as the sum of its digits (2+7 = 9).


Finally, put the code for each of the two parts into its own separate function, and have a menu in a `main()` function which allows you to choose
which of the two sets to find. This main program should keep
repeating until you choose to quit (use a "post-test", `while:True`, loop for this).

```
1) Find two digit numbers <= 56 with sums of digits > 10
2) Find two digit number minus number reversed which equals sum of digits
3) Quit

>1

(numbers go here)

1) Find two digit numbers <= 56 with sums of digits > 10
2) Find two digit number minus number reversed which equals sum of digits
3) Quit

>2

(number goes here)

1) Find two digit numbers <= 56 with sums of digits > 10
2) Find two digit number minus number reversed which equals sum of digits
3) Quit

>3

```
