# Execution Practice

This assignment is designed to give you practice running (executing) a Python program. Start by saving the following file to your classwork folder.

* [`star_wave.py`](../_static/examples/star_wave.py)

(You can save the file by right-clicking and choosing 
"`Save Target As...`" from the context menu.)

Then open up a terminal and navigate to where you saved the `star_wave.py` file.

```
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19043.1110]

C:\path\to\classwork\folder>python star_wave.py
*
**
*
**
***
...
C:\path\to\classwork\folder>

```

You should see a long-running program printing out waves of stars in the terminal. To forcibly stop long-running Python scripts, press `ctrl + c`.
