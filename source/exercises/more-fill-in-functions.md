# More Fill-In Functions


Download and finish the following code to practice working with
functions:

- [more_fill_in_functions.py](../_static/examples/more_fill_in_functions.py)

The functions are commented out. I would uncomment them one at a time once you get it correct.

If you do everything correctly, it should produce output like the
following:


```
Here we go.

Some random numbers, if you please: 
First: 2
Second: 8
They were not the same.

More counting, but this time not by ones: 2 4 6 8 10 8 6 4 2 
Let's figure a project grade.
434521 -> 71

Finally, some easy ones.Please enter your name: jose
Hi, jose

Do you feel lucky, punk?
