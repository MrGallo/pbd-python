# An Important Message

This exercise will show you the detailed steps you must follow
to create your first Python program.

Open up any text editor (Notepad, TextEdit) or IDE (VS Code, PyCharm).

Then, type in the code listed below. Save your file as "`important_message.py`". It is important you include the `.py` [file extension](https://www.howtogeek.com/356448/what-is-a-file-extension/).


```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**It's important that you resist the urge to copy and paste code when you are learning**.

Keep the file open; you will need it again if there are errors.

Open a command prompt. (`Win + r`, type `cmd`, click "ok")
Then type, in order, the commands below.

```
C:\path\to\classwork\folder>python first_prog.py
Hello, World!
C:\path\to\classwork\folder>
```

You did it! Now try changing the code so that the computer displays a different message.
