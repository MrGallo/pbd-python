# The Forgetful Machine

Ask the user for two words and two numbers, and let the
person at the keyboard type in some values, but don't bother
storing their responses into any variables.

Again, there is no need to create *any* variables. Just use the `input` and `print` functions.

Name the file:

`forgetful_machine.py`

```
Give me a word!
lorry! 
Give me a second word!
deoxyribonucleic? 
 
Great, now your favorite number?
42 
And your second-favorite number...
1 
 
Whew!  Wasn't that fun?
```
