# Basic Lists 1

Create an empty list. You *must* use a loop to append the value `-113` into the list *ten times*.

Additionally, create a second loop below the first that will iterate through the list and print out each element. Do not use a literal number in the `range()` function, you *must* use the `len()` function to inform the `range` function how many index numbers to generate.

Name your file `list1.py`

```
Slot 0 contains a -113
Slot 1 contains a -113
Slot 2 contains a -113
Slot 3 contains a -113
Slot 4 contains a -113
Slot 5 contains a -113
Slot 6 contains a -113
Slot 7 contains a -113
Slot 8 contains a -113
Slot 9 contains a -113
```
