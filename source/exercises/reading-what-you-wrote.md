# Reading What You Wrote


Again, make a class to store information about a car.

![Car UML](examples/uml-car.png)

Create a list to store five `Car` objects. (So far, this is the same as the previous assignment.)


Ask the user for the name of a file, and then open that file and read all the data from that file into the list (as `Car` objects).

Finally, display the values in the list.


```
From which file do you want to load this information? cars.txt
