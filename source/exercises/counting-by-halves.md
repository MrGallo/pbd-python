# Counting By Halves


Write a program that uses a `for` loop. With the loop,
make the variable `x` go from `-10` to `10`, counting by `0.5`. Since you cannot use float numbers (E.g., `0.5`) in the `range()` function, you need to think of another way to accomplish this.

Name the file: `counting_by_halves.py`

```
 
x
------
-10.0
-9.5
-9.0
-8.5
-8.0
...
9.0
9.5
10.0

```
