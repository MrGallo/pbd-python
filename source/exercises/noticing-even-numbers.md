# Noticing Even Numbers


Write a program that uses a `for`
loop to display all the numbers from `1` to `20`, marking those which
are even (divisible by two). You should should use modulus for this (`% 2`). If the
remainder is zero, it's divisible by `2`.

This means you'll need an `if` statement inside the loop.

Name your file: `notice_even.py`

```
# pseudo-code
for whatever...
    if someting with modulus:
        print("something")
    else:
        print("something different")

```



```
