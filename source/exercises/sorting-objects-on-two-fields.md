# Sorting Objects on Two Fields



Make a class to store information about a student's grades.

![Student UML](examples/uml-student2.png)

I have provided a file filled with grade information. It contains information for `30` students. Read the contents of the file into a list of `Student` objects.

```eval_rst
* :download:`gb.txt <examples/gb.txt>`
```

Then, rearrange the array so that grades are sorted by student by assignment number. That is, first sort the list by student id, then assignment number within each student.

```
Open which file: gb.txt

Data loaded.
Data sorted.

Here are the sorted grades:
	171 1 47 F
	171 2 64 D
	171 3 86 B
	171 4 26 F
	171 5 78 C
	171 6 70 C
	679 1 32 F
	679 2 41 F
	679 3 29 F
	679 4 21 F
	679 5 32 F
	679 6 70 F
	819 1 53 F
	819 2 70 C
	819 3 66 D
	819 4 73 C
	819 5 43 F
	819 6 37 F
	884 1 57 F
	884 2 81 B
	884 3 35 F
	884 4 44 F
	884 5 38 F
	884 6 34 F
	938 1 57 F
	938 2 65 D
	938 3 53 F
	938 4 28 F
	938 5 52 F
	938 6 43 F

```
