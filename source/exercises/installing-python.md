# Installing Python

Before you can start programming in Python, you will need the Python interpreter. The Python interpreter helps translate Python 
into [machine code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code).

Please follow Corey Schafer's video *[Python Tutorial for Beginners 1: Install and Setup for Mac and Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYXdXT2l-Gg)*. He will forward you to the [Python Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) page and show you what to do. You may also want to follow his other Python videos. They are all well done.

An Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
-------------------------------------------
When you watch the video Corey will recommend some IDEs like PyCharm and Atom. I suggest you get [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and it's [Python Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python). It's currently the most popular IDE. Microsoft also has a *[Getting Started with Python in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial)* tutorial (optional).

Corey Schafer also has a couple videos about VS Code specifically (optional viewing):
- [Visual Studio Code (Windows)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nh9rCzPJ20&ab_channel=CoreySchafer)
- [Visual Studio Code (Mac)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06I63_p-2A4&ab_channel=CoreySchafer)
