# Weekday Name

I have provided a function that is supposed to return the name of a day of the week given the day number.

## Files Needed
```eval_rst
* :download:`weekday_name.py <examples/weekday_name.py>`
```

Use `if`, `elif` and `else` to complete it according to the following table:

| Number | Weekday Name |
| - | - |
|1| Monday |
|2| Tuesday |
|3| Wednesday |
|4| Thursday |
|5| Fiday |
|6| Saturday |
|7| Sunday |
|0| Sunday |
|anything else| error

Save your solution as:

`weekday_name.py`
