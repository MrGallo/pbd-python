# Giving a List a Bunch of Values at Once

We're going to learn how to easily give starting values to a list when creating it!

Download the provided code, and get it to run.


## Files Needed


```eval_rst
* :download:`list_bunch_of_values.py <examples/list_bunch_of_values.py>`
```


What You Should See
-------------------
```
The first array is filled with the following values:
	alpha bravo charlie
```

After you add in the code you're supposed to, you should see something more like this:

```
The first list is filled with the following values:
	alpha bravo charlie delta echo

The second list is filled with the following values:
	11 23 37 41 53
```

What You Should Do on Your Own
------------------------------
Assignments turned in *without* these things will receive no credit.

1. The first list only has three values in it. Add two more, for a total of five.
2. Create a second list of `int`s, and give it five starting values, too.
3. Print the second list.
